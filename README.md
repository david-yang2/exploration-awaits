# Top Application Features

## Filtering car listings

<p>Currently, the filter component provide users the ability to filter through our inventory of overland cars by their Make, Model, and/or Drivetrain. By selecting a feature, the component will then find all unique features of that specific feature (e.g. if the Make button is selected, it will return Toyota, Jeep, and Subaru). When a user selects a specific feature, the component will map through each car listing object and compare it to the user's selected feature(s). The component will only render the car listing, if the user's selected features is included in any of the car listing object's feature(s).</p>
